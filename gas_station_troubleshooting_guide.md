# Gas Station Troubleshooting Guide

This guide documents the complete debugging journey for gas station integration issues in Aptos dApps, based on real troubleshooting experience. It shows the full path - including wrong turns and dead ends - before finding the actual solution.

## üö® Common Symptoms

### Primary Issue: Users Still Seeing Network Fees
- Gas station configured but users see fees like `0.000774 APT` instead of `$0.00`
- Wallet popup shows network fees before transaction submission
- Aptos Explorer shows user wallet as transaction sender (fee payer)
- Gas station dashboard shows "hits" but no actual sponsorship

## üìö The Complete Troubleshooting Journey

### Phase 1: Initial Suspicions (Wrong Track)
**‚ùå First Attempt: Suspected SDK Version Mismatch**

Initially thought the issue was package compatibility:
```json
// Found gas-station-client depends on ts-sdk v3.x
"@aptos-labs/gas-station-client": "^2.0.2" // requires ts-sdk v3.x
"@aptos-labs/ts-sdk": "^1.39.0" // we had v1.x
```

**Action Taken:** Upgraded ts-sdk from v1.39.0 to v3.1.3
**Result:** ‚ùå Still seeing fees - this wasn't the root cause

### Phase 2: Implementation Attempts (Partially Right Track)  
**‚ùå Second Attempt: Suspected Wrong API Usage**

Compared our code with external documentation and found differences:
- Documentation showed `createGasStationClient()` 
- We were using `new GasStationTransactionSubmitter()`
- Documentation showed `withFeePayer: true` parameter

**Action Taken:** 
1. Tried to find `createGasStationClient()` (didn't exist in our v2.0.2)
2. Added `withFeePayer: true` to transaction submissions
3. Added `transactionSubmitter` to wallet adapter config

```typescript
// Added this configuration
const transactionWithFeePayer = {
  ...transaction,
  withFeePayer: true,
};

// Added this to WalletProvider  
transactionSubmitter: aptosClient().config.getTransactionSubmitter?.(),
```

**Result:** ‚ùå Still seeing fees - closer but not the root cause

### Phase 3: Deep Analysis (Right Direction, Wrong Conclusion)
**‚ùå Third Attempt: Suspected Wallet Adapter Bypass**

Transaction logs showed:
```
üöÄ Attempting direct gas station transaction submission
‚ö†Ô∏è Direct gas station submission needs wallet signature - falling back  
üîÑ Using wallet adapter with configured gas station
üéØ Transaction with fee payer: {data: {...}, withFeePayer: true}
```

**Hypothesis:** Wallet adapter was ignoring gas station configuration despite correct parameters.

**Actions Taken:**
1. Added extensive logging to trace execution path
2. Analyzed transaction hashes on Aptos Explorer  
3. Confirmed wallet address was paying fees, not gas station
4. Suspected fundamental wallet adapter compatibility issues

**Result:** ‚ùå Still seeing fees - but logs showed our code was executing correctly

### Phase 4: MCP Consultation (The Right Approach)
**‚úÖ Finally Used Aptos MCP Tools**

After many failed attempts, consulted Aptos MCP resources:
```bash
mcp__aptos-mcp__get_specific_aptos_resource "how_to_config_a_gas_station_in_a_dapp"
mcp__aptos-mcp__get_aptos_build_applications
```

**MCP Revealed the Truth:** Our implementation was actually mostly correct, but showed exact API keys from dashboard.

### Phase 5: The Actual Root Cause (Character-Level Precision)
**‚úÖ Found the Real Issue: Wrong API Key**

Character-by-character comparison revealed:
```bash
# Our .env file (WRONG - had extra 'f')
VITE_APTOS_GAS_STATION_API_KEY=AG-GFSRDEKBCWXKDWHQYZKSFMZBJWAV3EAHf

# Actual API key from MCP dashboard (CORRECT)  
VITE_APTOS_GAS_STATION_API_KEY=AG-GFSRDEKBCWXKDWHQYZKSFMZBJWAV3EAH
```

**The Issue:** One extra character ('f') caused authentication failures with gas station service.

**Result:** ‚úÖ Immediate success - users now see $0.00 fees!

## üéØ Key Lessons from the Journey

### What We Learned the Hard Way:
1. **MCP First, Always** - We wasted hours on manual debugging when MCP had the answer
2. **Character-level precision matters** - A single extra character broke everything  
3. **Symptoms can be misleading** - Gas station "hits" in dashboard didn't mean authentication success
4. **Multiple fixes can mask the real issue** - Our code improvements were good but not the root cause
5. **Package versions weren't the problem** - Though upgrading was still beneficial

### What Actually Worked vs What Didn't:
**‚úÖ The ONLY essential fix:**
- Correct API key (the real solution - 1 character change)

**‚úÖ Code improvements made (beneficial but not root cause):**
- SDK version upgrade: `v1.39.0 ‚Üí v3.1.3` (still good practice for compatibility)
- Adding `withFeePayer: true` to transactions (MCP-compliant pattern)  
- Adding `transactionSubmitter` to wallet adapter (per MCP guidance)
- TypeScript fixes: removed unused imports, fixed type errors

**‚ùå Red herrings (wasted debugging time):**
- Complex wallet adapter debugging
- Trying to find non-existent `createGasStationClient()`
- Suspecting fundamental compatibility issues
- Deep transaction analysis on Aptos Explorer

**üîç Critical Insight:**
If the API key was always correct on Vercel but wrong locally, then **all the code changes were unnecessary** for fixing the core gas station issue. We may have been debugging a purely **local development configuration problem** while the production site worked correctly all along!

## üìù Detailed Code Changes Made During Journey

### Change #1: Package Version Upgrade
```json
// package.json - SDK compatibility upgrade
"@aptos-labs/ts-sdk": "^1.39.0" ‚Üí "^3.1.3"
```
**Reasoning:** gas-station-client v2.0.2 requires ts-sdk v3.x  
**Effect:** Fixed version compatibility warnings  
**For gas station:** Probably unnecessary if API key was the only issue

### Change #2: Wallet Provider Configuration
```typescript
// frontend/components/WalletProvider.tsx
dappConfig={{
  network: NETWORK,
  aptosApiKeys: { [NETWORK]: APTOS_API_KEY },
  // REMOVED: aptosClient: aptosClient(), (TypeScript error)
  // ADDED: Per MCP guidance
  transactionSubmitter: aptosClient().config.getTransactionSubmitter(),
}}
```
**Reasoning:** MCP guidance showed transactionSubmitter required  
**Effect:** More explicit gas station integration  
**For gas station:** May be required for proper MCP compliance, regardless of API key

### Change #3: Transaction Sponsorship Parameter
```typescript
// frontend/components/NFTGenerator.tsx
// ADDED: Explicit fee payer flag
const transactionWithFeePayer = {
  ...transaction,
  withFeePayer: true,
};
response = await signAndSubmitTransaction(transactionWithFeePayer);
```
**Reasoning:** Documentation emphasized withFeePayer: true requirement  
**Effect:** Explicit gas station sponsorship request  
**For gas station:** May be required for v2.0.2 API, regardless of API key

### Change #4: TypeScript Error Fixes
```typescript
// Multiple files - Clean up unused imports and type errors
// Removed: signTransaction (unused import)
// Fixed: account.address ‚Üí account.address.toString()
// Removed: MODULE_ADDRESS (unused import)
// Fixed: gasStationSubmitter reference in error logging
```
**Reasoning:** Build errors needed fixing  
**Effect:** Clean TypeScript compilation  
**For gas station:** No effect on functionality

## ü§î The Unanswered Question

**Were any of these code changes actually necessary?**

If the gas station worked correctly on Vercel (with correct API key) before any code changes, then:

- **API key fix:** 100% necessary for local development
- **Code improvements:** May have been unnecessary for core functionality  
- **Our debugging:** May have been solving a local-only configuration issue

**Test to verify:** Deploy the original code (before our changes) to Vercel with the correct API key and see if it works.

## üîç Systematic Debugging Approach (The Right Way)

### Step 1: Always Use Aptos MCP Tools First
**‚ùå Don't:** Try generic blockchain debugging or random fixes
**‚úÖ Do:** Consult Aptos MCP resources immediately

```bash
# Get specific guidance
mcp__aptos-mcp__get_specific_aptos_resource "how_to_config_a_gas_station_in_a_dapp"

# Get current API keys  
mcp__aptos-mcp__get_aptos_build_applications
```

### Step 2: Character-by-Character API Key Verification
**The most critical step we learned (should have been first!):**

```bash
# Use MCP to get exact API keys from dashboard
mcp__aptos-mcp__get_aptos_build_applications

# Compare character-by-character with .env file
# Our case: Wrong key had extra 'f'
WRONG: AG-GFSRDEKBCWXKDWHQYZKSFMZBJWAV3EAHf  
RIGHT: AG-GFSRDEKBCWXKDWHQYZKSFMZBJWAV3EAH
```

### Step 3: If API Key is Correct, Then Check Package Versions
**Root Cause #2: SDK Version Mismatches**

Common version conflicts:
```json
// Gas station client expects ts-sdk v3.x but project uses v1.x
"@aptos-labs/ts-sdk": "^1.39.0" // ‚ùå Too old
"@aptos-labs/gas-station-client": "^2.0.2" // Requires v3.x

// Fix: Upgrade ts-sdk to compatible version  
"@aptos-labs/ts-sdk": "^3.1.3" // ‚úÖ Compatible
```

### Step 4: Follow MCP Configuration Exactly
**Root Cause #3: Implementation Deviates from MCP Guidance**

#### Correct AptosConfig Setup:
```typescript
// utils/aptosClient.ts
const gasStationSubmitter = GAS_STATION_API_KEY
  ? new GasStationTransactionSubmitter({
      network: NETWORK,
      apiKey: GAS_STATION_API_KEY,
    })
  : undefined;

const config = new AptosConfig({
  network: NETWORK,
  clientConfig: { API_KEY: APTOS_API_KEY },
  pluginSettings: gasStationSubmitter
    ? { TRANSACTION_SUBMITTER: gasStationSubmitter }
    : undefined,
});
```

#### Correct Wallet Provider Setup:
```typescript
// components/WalletProvider.tsx
<AptosWalletAdapterProvider
  autoConnect
  dappConfig={{
    network: NETWORK,
    aptosApiKeys: { [NETWORK]: APTOS_API_KEY },
    aptosClient: aptosClient(),
    // CRITICAL: Add transaction submitter per MCP guidance
    transactionSubmitter: aptosClient().config.getTransactionSubmitter(),
  }}
>
```

#### Correct Transaction Submission:
```typescript
// Add withFeePayer: true for gas station sponsorship
const transactionWithFeePayer = {
  ...transaction,
  withFeePayer: true,
};
const response = await signAndSubmitTransaction(transactionWithFeePayer);
```

## üß™ Testing & Verification

### Verify Configuration is Working:
1. **Console logs should show:**
   ```
   Gas Station configured with API key: AG-GFSRDE...
   üéâ Gas Station enabled - contracts configured for zero-fee transactions!
   üéØ Transaction with fee payer: {data: {...}, withFeePayer: true}
   ```

2. **Wallet popup should show:** `$0.00` instead of fee amount

3. **Transaction analysis:**
   - Check Aptos Explorer transaction
   - Verify sender is still your wallet but fees are sponsored
   - Your wallet balance should remain unchanged

### Debug Transaction Results:
```typescript
// Add logging for transaction analysis
console.log("üîç TRANSACTION ANALYSIS:");
console.log("Hash:", response.hash);
console.log("Explorer:", `https://explorer.aptoslabs.com/txn/${response.hash}?network=${NETWORK}`);
```

## üéØ Key Success Indicators

### Before Fix:
- ‚ùå Wallet shows network fees (e.g., 0.000774 APT)
- ‚ùå User pays gas fees from their wallet
- ‚ùå Gas station dashboard shows hits but no sponsorship

### After Fix:
- ‚úÖ Wallet shows $0.00 for network fees
- ‚úÖ Transaction completes without deducting from user wallet
- ‚úÖ Gas station successfully sponsors transaction fees

## üí° Critical Insights from This Journey

### The Debugging Paradox
**Most of our "fixes" were actually correct implementations** that should have been there anyway, but they **masked the real issue** (wrong API key). This made debugging harder because we kept improving the code without solving the core problem.

### The MCP Lesson  
**We wasted several hours** trying manual debugging, SDK version analysis, and complex wallet adapter investigation when **MCP had the exact answer in minutes**. The gas station configuration resource showed both the correct implementation AND provided the exact API key that revealed our typo.

### Why This Was So Hard to Find
1. **Gas station dashboard showed "hits"** - misleading us to think authentication was working
2. **All our code improvements were technically correct** - making it seem like a deeper architectural issue  
3. **The error was silent** - no clear "authentication failed" message, just continued fee charging
4. **Multiple red herrings** - version incompatibilities, wallet adapter issues, etc. all seemed plausible

## üìö Lessons Learned (In Order of Importance)

1. **ü•á Use Aptos MCP tools FIRST, not last** - Would have saved hours of debugging
2. **ü•à Character-level precision in API keys is critical** - One wrong character = silent authentication failure  
3. **ü•â Misleading symptoms can send you down wrong paths** - "Hits" in dashboard ‚â† successful authentication
4. **Follow MCP guidance exactly** - Don't improvise or use generic blockchain patterns
5. **Good code improvements can mask root causes** - Be systematic about what actually fixes the issue

## üîß Correct Order Troubleshooting Checklist

### Phase 1: MCP First (Do This IMMEDIATELY)
- [ ] Consult `how_to_config_a_gas_station_in_a_dapp` MCP resource
- [ ] Get exact API keys with `mcp__aptos-mcp__get_aptos_build_applications`
- [ ] Compare API keys character-by-character with .env file

### Phase 2: Only If API Key Is Correct  
- [ ] Check package version compatibility  
- [ ] Verify MCP-compliant implementation
- [ ] Add required parameters (`withFeePayer: true`, `transactionSubmitter`)

### Phase 3: Testing & Verification
- [ ] Test and verify $0.00 fees in wallet popup
- [ ] Confirm transaction sponsorship via Explorer analysis

## üöÄ Expected Final Result

When properly configured:
1. User clicks "CLAIM NFT"
2. Wallet popup shows **$0.00** network fee
3. Transaction executes successfully
4. User's wallet balance unchanged
5. NFT minted and transferred to user
6. Gas station pays all network fees

This configuration enables a seamless, gasless user experience for your Aptos dApp.

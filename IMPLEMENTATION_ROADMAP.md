# Retro NFT Generator - Live Site Implementation Roadmap

## Project Overview
Transform the current user-owned collection demo into a production-ready shared collection that anyone can mint from, suitable for live Vercel deployment.

## Implementation Schedule

### Phase 1: Core Architecture Transformation âœ… IN PROGRESS
**Timeline: Week 1-2**
**Status: ðŸ”„ Active Development**

#### Completed Tasks âœ…
- [x] Create new branch `live-site` from main
- [x] Modify smart contract (`contract/sources/retro_nft_da.move`) for resource account shared collection pattern
  - [x] Added `SHARED_COLLECTION_SEED` constant for deterministic addressing
  - [x] Created `initialize_shared_collection()` admin function with resource account creation
  - [x] Modified `mint_random_nft()` to work with shared collection (no args needed)
  - [x] Removed user authorization checks - anyone can mint
  - [x] Updated view functions for shared collection address
  - [x] Added legacy compatibility functions
  - [x] Updated test functions for shared collection pattern
- [x] Update frontend for single collection flow
  - [x] Modified `initializeCollection.ts` to use shared collection functions
  - [x] Updated `mintRandomNft.ts` to remove creator address requirement
  - [x] Updated view functions (`checkCollectionExists.ts`, `getCollectionStats.ts`) for shared collection
  - [x] Modified `NFTGenerator.tsx` to remove user-specific collection logic
  - [x] Updated UI text to reflect shared collection concept
- [x] Add environment variables and utilities
  - [x] Added `VITE_SHARED_COLLECTION_ADDRESS` environment variable
  - [x] Created `frontend/utils/sharedCollection.ts` for address calculation
  - [x] Created `.env.example` with configuration guidance
  - [x] Added `scripts/calculate-collection-address.js` helper script

#### Completed Tasks âœ… (Phase 1 Complete!)
- [x] Test smart contract compilation - âœ… All tests passing
- [x] Frontend build testing - âœ… No TypeScript errors
- [x] Code cleanup and warning fixes
- [x] Comprehensive commit with all changes

#### Current Tasks ðŸ”„
- [ ] Deploy to testnet
- [ ] Verify end-to-end minting flow
- [ ] Test collection initialization and minting on testnet

#### Remaining Phase 1 Tasks
- [ ] Final documentation updates for deployment
- [ ] Testnet deployment verification

### Phase 2: Production Ready Deployment
**Timeline: Week 3**
**Status: ðŸ“… Planned**

#### Planned Tasks
- [ ] Gas Station integration for sponsored transactions (free minting for users)
  - [ ] Set up Aptos Gas Station configuration
  - [ ] Integrate gas sponsorship in frontend
  - [ ] Test sponsored transactions on testnet
- [ ] Rate limiting and abuse prevention
  - [ ] Implement per-IP mint limits
  - [ ] Add per-wallet mint limits (e.g., max 5 NFTs per wallet)
  - [ ] Add cooldown periods between mints
- [ ] Vercel deployment with monitoring
  - [ ] Production environment configuration
  - [ ] Deploy frontend to Vercel
  - [ ] Set up analytics and monitoring
  - [ ] Performance monitoring and alerts
- [ ] Mainnet deployment
  - [ ] Deploy smart contract to mainnet
  - [ ] Admin initialization of shared collection
  - [ ] Verify collection appears in Aptos explorers

### Phase 3: Enhanced Features & Ecosystem Integration
**Timeline: Week 4+**
**Status: ðŸ“‹ Future Enhancement**

#### Planned Enhancements
- [ ] User experience improvements
  - [ ] User NFT gallery view (show claimed NFTs)
  - [ ] Social sharing features for claimed NFTs
  - [ ] Enhanced preview system with rarity indicators
- [ ] Advanced rarity mechanics
  - [ ] Display trait rarity percentages
  - [ ] Rarity scoring system
  - [ ] Special rare NFT variants
- [ ] Marketplace integrations
  - [ ] Direct links to NFT marketplaces
  - [ ] Secondary market integration
  - [ ] Price tracking and analytics
- [ ] Community features
  - [ ] Leaderboards for early minters
  - [ ] Social media integration
  - [ ] Community challenges and events

## Technical Architecture Changes

### Smart Contract Changes
- **Resource Account Pattern**: Uses deterministic shared collection address via `account::create_resource_address()`
- **Shared Collection Model**: Single collection that anyone can mint from
- **Simplified Minting**: No user authorization checks, anyone can call `mint_random_nft()`
- **Admin Initialization**: One-time setup via `initialize_shared_collection()`

### Frontend Changes
- **Simplified UI Flow**: Removed per-user collection initialization
- **Global Statistics**: Shows collection-wide mint progress
- **Shared Collection Integration**: All functions point to shared collection address
- **Environment Configuration**: Support for production deployment variables

### Deployment Strategy
1. **Contract Deployment**: Deploy to network (testnet â†’ mainnet)
2. **Address Calculation**: Calculate shared collection address deterministically
3. **Admin Initialization**: Call `initialize_shared_collection()` once
4. **Frontend Deployment**: Deploy with known collection address
5. **Verification**: Ensure NFTs appear in explorers and wallets

## Key Benefits of New Architecture
- âœ… **Global Collection**: Single collection visible in all explorers
- âœ… **Simplified UX**: No individual collection setup required
- âœ… **Scalable**: No per-user collection management overhead
- âœ… **Production Ready**: Suitable for high-traffic deployment
- âœ… **Gas Efficient**: Optimized for mass adoption

## Current Status: Phase 1 - Core Architecture âœ… 95% Complete

**Next Steps:**
1. Test smart contract compilation and deployment
2. Deploy to testnet and verify functionality
3. Final frontend testing and bug fixes
4. Move to Phase 2: Production deployment
